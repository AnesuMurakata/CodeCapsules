# How to Create and Host a Telegram Bot on Code Capsules

## What Will We Learn? 

In [this](linktoapitutorialhere.io) tutorial we created and hosted an API on Code Capsules. Today, we'll cover one of many ways we can use this API to make something useful – we'll create a Telegram bot. Creating a Telegram Bot is an excellent way to learn more about APIs and to make something that you can interact with. By messaging our bot, we'll get the temperature and weather data from the API we created. 

We'll also learn how to host this bot on [Code Capsules](https://codecapsules.io/), so anyone at any time can text your bot and retrieve the weather and currency exchange rates. Along the way, we'll learn some key concepts about hosting bots securely and efficiently.

Let's get started!

## Requirements

To create a Telegram bot, we'll need:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.6+ installed.
- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.
- [Virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/) installed.
- A [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) account.
- A [Code Capsules](https://codecapsules.io/) account.
- To have created an API following [this](linktoapitutorialhere.ioo) tutorial.

## About Telegram Bots

Telegram bots act as Telegram accounts – no extra phone number necessary. Users interact with Telegram bots by sending commands to them. Commands sent to the bot's account on Telegram pass to wherever the bot's programming is stored (in our case, on Code Capsules).

The command determines what will return – for example, when we send "/weather" to our bot later in this article, the message returned to us will be the weather data from [this](linktoapitutorial) tutorial.

Let's create a Telegram bot.

## Registering a Bot Account and Talking to the BotFather

To create a Telegram bot we need to download [Telegram](https://telegram.org/). Both desktop and phone versions of Telegram will work. 

Registering a bot with Telegram is an interactive process – first, we need to talk to the "BotFather".

1. Log in to Telegram.
2. Search for the account "BotFather".
3. Start a chat with the BotFather.

As the name suggests, the BotFather is a bot – a bot that helps developers create other Telegram bots. Follow these steps to create a bot with the BotFather:

1. Press "start".
2. Type `/newbot`.
3. Choose a name for your bot.
4. Choose a username for your bot (must end in "bot").

Once you've chosen a username, the BotFather will reply with some very **important** information. For every new bot, the BotFather generates an __authorization token__ – a string that enables your bot to send requests to the Telegram Bot API. Make sure to save this token somewhere.

To see if the bot was successfully created, search for the bot's username. You should see the bot and be able to start a conversation with it. Right now, we can only `/start` a conversation with our bot – without any programming, there won't be much to say, and the bot won't reply.

Let's give our bot something to say. 

## Developing Bot Functionality

We're going to implement two commands for our bot.

- When we send the command `/weather` to our bot account on Telegram, we want to receive the weather data from the API we created. 

- Sending the command `/currency` will return the exchange rate from USD to CAD, EUR, and ZAR.

Let's get started.

### Creating the Virtual Environment and Installing Requirements

First, we need to create a directory. Do so, then in the same directory, open a terminal and create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) by entering `virtualenv env`.

Enter the virtual environment using the appropriate command:

**Linux/MacOSX**

`source env/bin/activate`

**Windows**

`env\Scripts\activate.bat`

The virtual environment will help manage our dependencies for when we host the bot on Code Capsules.

To interact with the Telegram bot API, we need to download the [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) library, a Python wrapper for the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api). 

We'll also use the Python library `requests`  to retrieve data from the weather and currency exchange rate API.

Enter `pip install python-telegram-bot requests` in the terminal to install these requirements. 

### Retrieving Data from the API

With the virtual environment ready and the requirements installed, we can start coding. Create a file named `bot.py` in the same directory where we activated the virtual environment. 

Remember: when we message our bot `/currency` or `/weather`, we want the bot to return the currency and weather data from the API created in [this article](linktoartice.io).

Open the `bot.py` file. Retrieve the API data by copying and pasting the following, replacing `YOUR-URL-HERE` with the URL pointing to the weather and exchange rate API hosted on Code Capsules.

```python
import requests

url = 'YOUR-URL-HERE/GET'
data = requests.get(url) # requests data from API
data = data.json() # converts return data to json

# Retrieve values from API
curr_temp = data['curr_temp']
cad_rate = data['usd_rates']['CAD']
eur_rate = data['usd_rates']['EUR']
zar_rate = data['usd_rates']['ZAR']


def return_weather():
	print('Hello. The current temperature in Cape Town is: '+str(curr_temp)+" celsius.")


def return_rates():
	print("Hello. Today, USD conversion rates are as follows: USD->CAD = "+str(cad_rate)+
		", USD->EUR = "+str(eur_rate)+", USD->ZAR = "+str(zar_rate))


return_weather()

return_rates()
```

Here we request the currency and weather data from the API and parse the temperature and conversion rates. Then we print out the data using `return_weather()` and `return_rates()`

Try it out! Run the program to ensure everything works, then continue. 

### Creating the Bot

Now we can get to creating the actual bot. At the top of the `bot.py` file, add the line:
```python
from telegram.ext import Updater, CommandHandler
```
From the `python-telegram-bot` library, we import two classes: `Updater` and `CommandHandler`. We'll talk about these classes soon.

We don't need to print our data anymore – we'll instead return a string to our bot, so the bot can display it on Telegram. Replace `def return_weather()` and `def return_rates()` with:

```python
def return_weather():
	return'Hello. The current temperature in Cape Town is: '+str(curr_temp)+" celsius."


def return_rates():
	return "Hello. Today, USD conversion rates are as follows: USD->CAD = "+str(cad_rate)+ ", USD->EUR = "+str(eur_rate)+", USD->ZAR = "+str(zar_rate)
```

Now, replace the `return_weather()` and `return_rates()` function calls with:

```python

def weather(update, context):
    context.bot.send_message(chat_id=update.effective_chat.id, text=return_weather())

def currency(update, context):
	context.bot.send_message(chat_id=update.effective_chat.id, text=return_rates())

def start(update, context):
	context.bot.send_message(chat_id=update.effective_chat.id, text='Hi! I respond to /weather and /currency. Try these!')

def main():
	updater = Updater(token='YOUR-BOT-TOKEN-HERE', use_context=True)
	dispatcher = updater.dispatcher

	weather_handler = CommandHandler('weather', weather)
	currency_handler = CommandHandler('currency',currency)
	start_handler = CommandHandler('start',start)

	dispatcher.add_handler(weather_handler)
	dispatcher.add_handler(currency_handler)
	dispatcher.add_handler(start_handler)

	updater.start_polling()

if __name__ == '__main__':
	main()

```

Let's break down what's happening here, starting from the beginning of `def main()`:


We instantiate an `Updater()` class and assign it to the variable `updater`.
- The [Updater](https://python-telegram-bot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/telegram.ext.updater.html#telegram.ext.updater.Updater) class retrieves updates (such as commands sent to our bot) from Telegram and passes them to the [Dispatcher](https://python-telegram-bot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/telegram.ext.dispatcher.html#telegram.ext.Dispatcher) class.

-Upon `Updater` instantiation, a `Dispatcher` is created automatically for us. We access this `Dispatcher` class with the line `dispatcher = updater.dispatcher`.

Next, we create three different `CommandHandler` classes.
- As the name suggests, a `CommandHandler` handles Telegram commands.
	
- For example, the line `weather_handler = CommandHandler(...)` allows us to message our bot `/weather`. When `/weather` is sent, the `weather()` function calls.


Looking above `def main()` We see `def weather(...)`, `def currency(....)` and `def start(...)`. These functions provide the logic for our bot commands. 

- Note: we define a function named `start()`. This function defines what happens when we `/start` a conversation with our bot.


Taking a closer look at the `def weather()` function definition:

- This function calls the `python-telegram-bot` function `send_message()`. 

- The `text=return_weather()` parameter means that the bot will display thetext returned by calling the `return_weather()` function. 


Looking back to the `main()` function, we add the `weather_handler`, `currency_handler` and `start_handler` to our `dispatcher`. 

- When our Telegram bot receives a command, the dispatcher will activate and handle any commands sent to it.


Finally, `updater.start_polling()` begins _polling_ updates from Telegram  -  our application will "poll" our Telegram bot for any commands sent to it.

- In the [next](#polling-vs.-webhook) section we'll talk about the pitfalls with polling and look at an alternative.


The code `bot.py` file should now look like this – once again, make sure to replace `YOUR-URL-HERE` with the URL of the API created in the [API tutorial](link-to-API-tutorial-here)


```python
from telegram.ext import Updater, CommandHandler
import requests


url = 'YOUR-URL-HERE/GET'
data = requests.get(url) # requests data from API
data = data.json() # converts return data to json

# Retrieve values from API
curr_temp = data['curr_temp']
cad_rate = data['usd_rates']['CAD']
eur_rate = data['usd_rates']['EUR']
zar_rate = data['usd_rates']['ZAR']


def return_weather():
	return'Hello. The current temperature in Cape Town is: '+str(curr_temp)+" celsius."

def return_rates():
	return "Hello. Today, USD conversion rates are as follows: USD->CAD = "+str(cad_rate)+ ", USD->EUR = "+str(eur_rate)+", USD->ZAR = "+str(zar_rate)

def weather(update, context):
    context.bot.send_message(chat_id=update.effective_chat.id, text=return_weather())

def currency(update, context):
	context.bot.send_message(chat_id=update.effective_chat.id, text=return_rates())

def start(update, context):
	context.bot.send_message(chat_id=update.effective_chat.id, text='Hi! I respond to /weather and /currency. Try these!')

def main():
	updater = Updater(token='YOUR-BOT-TOKEN-HERE', use_context=True)
	dispatcher = updater.dispatcher

	weather_handler = CommandHandler('weather', weather)
	currency_handler = CommandHandler('currency',currency)
	start_handler = CommandHandler('start',start)

	dispatcher.add_handler(weather_handler)
	dispatcher.add_handler(currency_handler)
	dispatcher.add_handler(start_handler)

	updater.start_polling()

if __name__ == '__main__':
	main()
```

Below is a "conversation" with a bot created using this program. Run `bot.py` and try it out yourself.

![conversation](images/conversation.png)

Notice, we **won't** be able to send messages to our bot if this program isn't running – this is where hosting the program on Code Capsules will come in handy. When we've hosted it on Code Capsules, we can message our bot from any computer or phone.

We've created a bot and are almost ready to deploy it to Code Capsules – there is, however, a downside to our current implementation. Let's take a look at it.

### Polling v. Webhooks

There are two ways for our `bot.py` file to sense updates (commands sent to our bot). 

Currently, the `bot.py` file "polls" Telegram constantly, requesting info from the Telegram API regardless of whether a command was sent to the bot. If we hosted this current version on Code Capsules, we would be wasting bandwidth – more often than not, the poll will return no new updates.

Instead of polling Telegram for changes, we can create a __Webhook__. Webhooks send data when an action occurs –  instead of our application regularly requesting updates from our bot (regardless of if there are any updates), it'll only send information **if** the bot on Telegram received a command.

When we host our bot on Code Capsules, we'll receive a URL for our application on Code Capsules. We'll set up a webhook by telling Telegram to send us any commands sent to our bot account to our application on Code Capsules (using the URL). Our application will then process the command and send back the requested information.  

You can imagine it this way:

1. We send "/weather" to our bot on Telegram.

2. Telegram tells our application on Code Capsules that the command "/weather" was sent.

3. Our application runs the `weather()` function, and returns the weather to Telegram to display in the chat. 

Let's set up a webhook for our bot.

### Creating a Webhook

To set up the webhook, replace `def main()` with

```python
def main():

	PORT = int(os.environ.get('PORT','8443'))
	updater = Updater(token='YOUR-BOT-TOKEN-HERE', use_context=True)
	dispatcher = updater.dispatcher

	weather_handler = CommandHandler('weather', weather)
	currency_handler = CommandHandler('currency',currency)
	start_handler = CommandHandler('start',start)

	dispatcher.add_handler(weather_handler)
	dispatcher.add_handler(currency_handler)
	dispatcher.add_handler(start_handler)


	updater.start_webhook(listen='0.0.0.0', port=PORT, url_path = TOKEN)
	updater.bot.setWebhook('YOUR-CODECAPSULES-URL HERE'+TOKEN)
	updater.idle()

```

We've only changed a couple of things. Starting from the top:

- `PORT`: The port on our Code Capsules server from which our bot will receive information from Telegram.

- `updater.start_webhook()`: This starts an HTTP server to listen for our webhook - you can find more information about this function in [this documention](https://python-telegram-bot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/telegram.ext.updater.html).

- `updater.bot.setWebhook('YOUR-CODECAPSULES-URL-HERE'+TOKEN)`: This function sets the webhook - we'll replace "YOUR-CODECAPSULES_URL-HERE" when we create a Capsule to host our bot on.

- `update.idle()`: Read more about this function [here](https://python-telegram-bot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/telegram.ext.updater.html).


The webhook is ready to go – the last thing left is to consider the security of our bot. 

### Creating an API Key Environment Variable

Because we'll push our code to GitHub, we need to hide our bots authentication key. If we don't, anyone could use our authentication key and take control of our bot.

Replace the line

```python
updater = Updater(token='YOUR-BOT-TOKEN-HERE', use_context=True)
```
with the below
```python
updater = Updater(token=os.getenv('BOTAPIKEY'), use_context=True)
```

`os.getenv('BOTAPIKEY')` will look for an [environment variable](https://medium.com/chingu/an-introduction-to-environment-variables-and-how-to-use-them-f602f66d15fa) with the name "BOTAPIKEY". When we host our bot on Code Capsules, we'll set this environment variable - judging by the name, you may have guessed that the environment variable "BOTAPIKEY" will store our bot's API key.

With that done, we have some files we need to create before we can push our code to GitHub and deploy it on Code Capsules. 

## Creating the Procfile and Detailing Requirements

Before pushing our code to GitHub, we need to create some files so Code Capsules can run our bot. First, we'll need to create  `Procfile`. This file will tell Code Capsules how to run the `bot.py` file.

Then we'll create a file `requirements.txt`. This file will tell Code Capsules which tell Code Capsules which libraries to install to be able to run our `bot.py` file.

To create the `Procfile`:
1. Navigate to the directory containing the `bot.py` file and enter the virtual environment.

2. Create a file named `Procfile` (with no file extension).

3. Open the `Procfile`, enter `web: python3 app.py`, and save the file.

In the same directory, open a terminal and activate the virtual environment. Then enter `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt` to generate a list of requirements for our Code Capsules server.

Now we can push our code to GitHub. Create a GitHub repository and send the `requirements.txt`, `Procfile`, and `bot.py` files to the repository. 

## Deploying the Bot to Code Capsules

With all of the files sent to GitHub, let's deploy the bot to Code Capsules:
1. Log in to Code Capsules, and create a Team and Space as necessary.

2. Link Code Capsules to the GitHub repository created [previously](#creating-the-procfile-and-detailing-requirements
).
3. Enter your Code Capsules Space.
4. Create a new Capsule, selecting the "Backend" capsule type.
5. Select the GitHub repository containing the bot – leave "Repo subpath" empty and press "Next"
6. Leave the "Run Command" blank and press "Create Capsule"

We just have a few more steps to complete for the bot to work. 

### Creating an Environment Variable and Supplying Our URL

Remember: We haven't supplied our webhook a URL yet, and we still need to create an environment variable for our bots authorization token. To create an environment variable:

1. Navigate to your Capsule.

2. Click the "Config" tab.
3. Add an environment variable named "BOTAPIKEY" with the value being the bots authorization key – make sure to hit **update** after adding the variable.

![env-var](images/env_var.png)

Next, let's supply our webhook with the correct domain.

1. Navigate to the "Overview" tab.

2. Copy the domain found under "Domains".
3. Open the `bot.py` file and find the line `updater.bot.setWebhook('YOUR-CODECAPSULES-URL HERE'+TOKEN)`
4. Replace "YOUR-CODECAPSULES_URL" with the domain just copied.
5. Commit and push these changes to GitHub.

After pushing these changes, the Capsule will re-build. Once the Capsule builds, the bot is ready. Give it a try – the bot is complete.
